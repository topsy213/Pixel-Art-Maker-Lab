# Pixel Art Maker Project

## Build a Grid-Style table.

* With this web app, you can create table grids of any number of grids, and you can add color to specified data cells.

## Instructions

Change the Height and Width values; by either entering the value or using the UP and Down arrows, and click the Submit button.
After creating the table, you can select a color of choice from the Color Picker, and paint any cell as you wish.

## Contributing
Pixel Art Maker is a vector based grid system; where you can create colored patterns in the form of a plait and check. Just like a Chess board canvas. Paint the grids as you like.
